Linux for perfectionists

This is a work in-progress.

Perfection Linux is inspired by the Suicide Linux project.

But I wanted sometehing even harder.

Perfection linux destroys your system any time you run something that doesn't return with an exit code of 0.
Perfect commands only.

##Instalation
`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s00ner/perfection-linux/master/perfection.bashrc > /etc/bash.bashrc'

That's it for now. This only works on distros that use /etc/bash.bashrc and I've only confirmed it on Ubuntu and Debian.
